2013/05/09,optimizely.com,Optimizely  ,Optimizely  ,"Optimizely is an early-stage, well-funded startup based in San Francisco, California. The company was founded by two former product managers from Google, Dan Siroker and Pete Koomen.  Dan served as the Director of Analytics during the Obama 2008 presidential campaign.  While there his team relied on the use of A/B and multivariate testing to maximize email sign-ups, volunteers, and donations to raise over $100 million in additional revenue for the campaign. But optimization was hard - you needed technical skills and know-how to run even the simplest of tests.  After the campaign, Siroker teamed up with Koomen to create a world-class optimization platform that was easy to use - to provide a platform for business people to be able to conceive and run experiments that helped them make better data-driven decisions. Since completing YCombinator in the winter of 2010, Optimizely has seen strong and growing demand.  Highlights include:In less than two years our first product has passed established players to become the leading A/B and multivariate testing platform in the world. Over 2,000 enterprises have adopted Optimizely including Starbucks, Disney, Salesforce, eBay, and Crate&Barrel. In 2010 and 2011 the company's revenues increased 1,266 percent year-over-year and we hit profitability in 2012. "
